# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

![Tic-Tac-Toe Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe AI** project! This repository contains an implementation of an AI agent that can play Tic-Tac-Toe against a human or another AI. The AI is powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, which ensures optimal play for the game.

## 🧠 **AI Implementation**

The AI utilizes the **Minimax algorithm**, a recursive method that evaluates possible moves to maximize the AI's chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances. The AI always plays optimally, ensuring no possible win is overlooked.

### 🌟 Features:
- **Two Play Modes**: Human vs AI and AI vs AI.
- **Optimal Strategy**: AI plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm.
- **Game Board Visualization**: The board is displayed after each move.
- **Customizable**: Future support for GUI enhancements.

## ⚙️ **Technologies Used**:
- **Languages**: Python 🐍
- **Algorithm**: Minimax Algorithm 🤖
- **Libraries**: None (pure Python implementation)
